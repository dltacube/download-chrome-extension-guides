# download-chrome-extension-guides
A script used to download and format all of the html pages associated with the chrome extension documentation.

Credit goes to [Georg Barikin](https://github.com/gebrkn) for writing most of the code. The original script can be found [here](https://github.com/gebrkn/bits/blob/master/chromeapi_docset.js) and also supports downloading the Google Apps documentation, but in this iteration that has not been tested.
